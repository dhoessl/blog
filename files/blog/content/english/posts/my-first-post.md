# What can you expect here

As far as I feel like it, I will write an entry about topics I am working on.
I will break down how I use technologies, how I use them and what mistakes I made, so that someone else doesn't have to solve the same problems.

# What do I write about

Basically, there should be something about the following topics:
* Python3
* Ansible
* Microcontroller projects

It is not excluded that I will also write about other topics that are on my mind.

# Inspiration

Since I keep running into problems that can only be solved by digging together from different sources, I wanted to provide a post providing the solution to these problems.

My thanks go to [Syphdias](https://github.com/Syphdias), who showed me Hugo & PaperMod as tools to write down my thoughts.
